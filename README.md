#	Solution Manual For PRML

### Instruction
This is a Solution Manual for the famous book [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) written by me.

The Manual is written in LaTex, and I ommit other files generated by Tex, so that you can only view the [pdf file for solutions](https://github.com/GoldenCheese/PRML-learning/blob/master/Solution%20Manual%20For%20PRML.pdf). I will keep update the solutions as my learning process goes on (I will solve at least one problem every day :-) ).

There are some solutions that I am not sure. I have listed here: Problem 2.37, Problem 2.58, Problem 3.13, Problem 3.14, Problem 3.16.

It you have any question, find any wrong solution or come up with better ideas about the problems I listed above, please feel free to contact with me <zhengqigao@163.com> or <14307130100@fudan.edu.cn>

Finally, because of the copyright and the respect to my idol, C.Bishop,  I will only upload the solutions for the first three chapters, you can contact with me about the exercises, I'm willing to discuss and help!

### Update List
