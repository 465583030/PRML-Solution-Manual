#	Solution Manual For PRML

### Instruction
This is a Solution Manual for the famous book [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf).

The Manual is written in LaTex, and I ommit other files generated by Tex, so that you can only view the [pdf file for solutions](https://github.com/GoldenCheese/PRML-learning/blob/master/Solution%20Manual%20For%20PRML.pdf). I will keep update the solutions as my learning process goes on (I will solve at least one problem every day :-) ).

There are some solutions that I am not sure. I have listed here: Problem 2.37, Problem 2.58, Problem 3.13, Problem 3.14, Problem 3.16.

It you have any question, find any wrong solution or come up with better ideas about the problems I listed above, please feel free to contact with me <zhengqigao@163.com> or <14307130100@fudan.edu.cn>

Finally, because of the copyright, i.e., it is not legal for me to upload/publish all the solutions since PRML is not written by me,  I will only upload the solutions for the first three chapters just for your reference, you can contact with me about the exercises, I'm willing to discuss and help!

PLEASE DONNT TAKE IT FOR OTHER USES.

### Update List

**Sep22,2018**
